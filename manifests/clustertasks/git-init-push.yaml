      This is a lazy task that just takes a workspace, runs git init and adds
      a remote url before pushing it.
      It's expected that the serviceAccount used to run this task has the
      authentication credentials for the git repo.
      See https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/auth/#basic-auth-for-git for
      details.
spec:
  # These are all required parameters to the task when we write a Pipeline using
  # this task, we must ensure that these parameters are supplied.
